            Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio, My name is Joseph Meagalli but most people just call me Joe. I was born in New Zealand
            but resettled here in Australia when i was young so now i call Australia home.
            A little about myself, I am originally from a contruction/labour background but have been studying in the IT
            field in the last few years. I have always enjoyed the IT industry since i was a young lad. 
            One of my hobbies is travelling and one of my favourite places to travel to is Japan or in their language they call it 'Nihon'.
            I have travelled to this homogeneous society a few times and each time there is always something new to do. 
            My goal is to become a prominent front-end web developer within the Brisbane community.

        <h2 class="h2-title">Languages</h2>
            <div class="lang">
            HTML,CSS,SCSS and Ruby are just some of the languages we have learnt at Coder Academy.
            Its a really interesting environment to learn in, coming from a background where i already have programming knowledge.
            I found ruby to be a bit difficult at first because i couldn't grasp it very well and i still trouble with it but it is 
            getting easier. When i first started this course back in january we started using a language called ruby and by the 3rd or 4th week we had 
            created a terminal app with ruby. We were in teams of two and my team created a recipe list for coffee. The ruby app was fun to create even though we were limited
            on how long we had. This time round we had a lot longer to work on this project and i found this assessment very interesting and it seemed to bring out my creative 
            streak which i never knew i had.
