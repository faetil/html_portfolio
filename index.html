                Hello and thank you for visiting my portfolio, My name is Joseph Meagalli but most people just call me
                Joe.
                I was born in New Zealand
                but resettled here in Australia when i was young so now i call Australia home.
                A little about myself, I am originally from a contruction/labour background but have been studying in
                the IT
                field in the last few years. I have always enjoyed the IT industry since i was a young lad.
                One of my hobbies is travelling and one of my favourite places to travel to is Japan or in their
                language
                they call it 'Nihon'.
                I have travelled to this homogeneous society a few times and each time there is always something new to
                do.
                My goal is to become a prominent front-end web developer within the Brisbane community. I have also been
                taking codecademy as well
                as freecodecamp online course when i have free time.
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML,CSS,SCSS and Ruby are just some of the languages we have learnt at Coder Academy.
                Its a really interesting environment to learn in, coming from a background where i already have
                programming
                knowledge.
                I found ruby to be a bit difficult at first because i couldn't grasp it very well and i still trouble
                with
                it but it is
                getting easier. When i first started this course back in january we started using a language called ruby
                and
                by the 3rd or 4th week we had
                created a terminal app with ruby. We were in teams of two and my team created a recipe list for coffee.
                The
                ruby app was fun to create even though we were limited
                on how long we had. This time round we had a lot longer to work on this project and i found this
                assessment
                very interesting and it seemed to bring out my creative streak which i never knew i had. here is a link
                to me Will's <a href="https://github.com/WClifford1/Ruby-Terminal-Assessment">Ruby Terminal</a>
                I feel that the terminal app was quite well done and i enjoyed it. This portfolio i also enjoyed it too
                where i will also be adding more features later on as the technologies are learnt.
