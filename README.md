#Description of
#purpose
The purpose of this website/portfolio is to show the skills that i have learned throughout this course and present them in a accessible, functional and useable way.

#functionality / features
I have created a webpage/portfolio using the parallax effect as the main selling point with flex incorporated into the sections of the website. I have also added a nav bar to the header so the user can navigate to different sections of the webpage. Social media links have been added to the header as well as the footer.

#target audience
My target audience is potential employers, but also potential clients as well so they can see what i can do. 

#Tech stack(html, css, deployment platform etc)
The stack i have used is for this portfolio is mainly html5 and ccs. I have deployed the platform onto github pages that way the portfolio can be accessed via the internet

#Design process
For the design process i wanted a very simple look with city images in the background. I designed the moodboard around that 

#wireframes
i have made a hand sketched and also a application using wirify so i have provided image links to both of them.

#project plan & timeline
I had originally planned the website to use bootstrap but it seemed to much trouble for what it was worth. so i decided to use flex. The time line i had for website was in this process: flowchart --> moodboard --> wireframe --> code website.
