#Description of
#purpose
The purpose of this website/portfolio is to show the skills that i have learned throughout this course and present them in a accessible, functional and useable way.

#functionality / features
I have created a webpage/portfolio using the parallax effect as the main selling point with flex incorporated into the sections of the website. I have also added a nav bar to the header so the user can navigate to different sections of the webpage. Social media links have been added to the header as well as the footer.
