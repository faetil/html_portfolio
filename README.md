#Description of
#purpose
The purpose of this website/portfolio is to show the skills that i have learned throughout this course and present them in a accessible, functional and useable way.
I have showed this portfolio in a city background image so it will give the feel of a city style.

#functionality / features
I have created a webpage/portfolio using the parallax effect as the main selling point with flex incorporated into the sections of the website. I have also added a nav bar to the header so the user can navigate to different sections of the webpage. Social media links have been added to the header as well as the footer. There is also a mailto link added at the bottom section someone needs to email me.

#target audience
My target audience is potential employers, but also potential clients as well so they can see what i can do. 

#Tech stack(html, css, deployment platform etc)
The stack i have used is for this portfolio is mainly html5 and ccs. I have deployed the platform onto github pages that way the portfolio can be accessed via the internet. I would have liked to use javascript or react but at this current period in time i have no knowledge of either of them.

#Design process
For the design process i wanted a very simple look with city images in the background. I designed the moodboard around that, as well as the wireframes. I actually had to look up parallax as i wanted to incorporate it into the website as its main feature. While i was looking for icon images i decided to have them in the header and footer to make it look more sleek.

#wireframes
i have made a hand sketched and also a application using wirify so i have provided image links to both of them.

#usability considerations
Because it is a very simple webpage the usability of the website could be considered for 

#project plan & timeline
I had originally planned the website to use bootstrap but it seemed to much trouble for what it was worth. so i decided to use flex. The time line i had for website was in this process: flowchart --> moodboard --> wireframe --> code website.

#What i would of liked to implement
What i would of liked to implement was have more sections on the portfolio as well as having a sticky navbar. 


#Short Q&A 
A little Q & A: 
regarding Accessibility I feel that it could be improved in some areas for example, i wasnt able to implement a sticky nav bar in time.
