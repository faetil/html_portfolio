#Description of
#purpose
The purpose of this website/portfolio is to show the skills that i have learned throughout this course and present them in a accessible, functional and useable way.
I have showed this portfolio in a city background image so it will give the feel of a city style.

#functionality / features
I have created a webpage/portfolio using the parallax effect as the main selling point with flex incorporated into the sections of the website. I have also added a nav bar to the header so the user can navigate to different sections of the webpage. Social media links have been added to the header as well as the footer. There is also a mailto link added at the bottom section someone needs to email me.

#target audience
My target audience is potential employers, but also potential clients as well so they can see what i can do. 

#Tech stack(html, css, deployment platform etc)
The stack i have used is for this portfolio is mainly html5 and ccs. I have deployed the platform onto github pages that way the portfolio can be accessed via the internet. I would have liked to use javascript or react but at this current period in time i have no knowledge of either of them.

#Design process
For the design process i wanted a very simple look with city images in the background. I designed the moodboard around that, as well as the wireframes. I actually had to look up parallax as i wanted to incorporate it into the website as its main feature. While i was looking for icon images i decided to have them in the header and footer to make it look more sleek.

#wireframes
i have made a hand sketched and also a application using wirify so i have provided image links to both of them.

#usability considerations
Because it is a very simple webpage the usability of the website could be considered for profile portfolio or something similar. It could also be used in a responsive website.

#project plan & timeline
I had originally planned the website to use bootstrap but it seemed to much trouble for what it was worth. so i decided to use flex. The time line i had for website was in this process: flowchart --> moodboard --> wireframe --> code website.

#What i would of liked to implement
What i would of liked to implement was have more sections on the portfolio as well as having a sticky navbar. 


#Short Q&A 
A little Q & A: 
regarding Accessibility I feel that it could be improved in some areas for example, i wasnt able to implement a sticky nav bar in time.

Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today?
1. Transmission Control Protocol(TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) as the protocol suite, commonly known as TCP/IP emerge as the protocol for ARPANET. This results in the fledgling definition of the internet as connected TCP/IP internets. TCP/IP remains the standard protocol for internet
2. The domain name system(DNS) establishes the familiar .edu .gov .com .mil .org .net and .int system for naming websites. This is easier than remembering ip addresses.
3. The number of hosts on the internet exceeds 20,000. Cisco ships its first router.
4. World.std.com becomes the first commercial provider for dial-up access to the
internet.
5. Tim Berners-Lee develops the hypertext markup language(HTML)
6. CERN introduces the world wide web to the public
7. Netscape Communications is born. Microsoft creates a web browser for windows
95
8. Google search engine is born
9. Internet protocol version 6 is introduced
10.The dot-com bubble bursts, Yahoo and eBay are hit by DDOS 11.Judge shuts down napster
12.Facebook goes online
13.Youtube launches
Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers
Domain:​ A domain in the words of networking refers to any group of users, workstations, devices, printers, computers and database servers that share different types of data via a network resource.
A subset of the internet with addresses sharing a common suffix or under control of a particular organisation or individual.
Web Server:​ Can refer to hardware or software or both of them working together. At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file which is hosted on a web server the browser requests the file via HTTP(hypertext transfer protocol). A web server can in general contain one or more websites. A web server can process HTTP and several other protocols.
DNS:​ Is a naming system for computers, services or other resources connected to the internet or a private network. The domain name system has been an essential
component of the functionality of the internet since 1985. People would call the DNS the internets versions of a phone book. They maintain a directory of domain names and translate them into Internet Protocol(IP) address. Host companies and internet service providers interact with the central registry on a regular schedule to get updated DNS information.
Web Browsers:​ Is a software application for accessing information on the world wide web. Each web page, image, video is identified by a distinct Uniform Resource Locator(URL). Enabling browsers to retrieve resources from a web server and display them on the client browser.
Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today?
We treat relationships differently: The internet has affected the way we form and maintain relationships with friends, family, partners and acquaintances. We can now interact with each other and keep each other updated more readily than we did in the past
Everything’s crowd based: The 21st century saw the rise of social media and other interactive platforms. This revolution saw the way we think about our personal lives because of the internet we have access to a huge pool of ideas and options
We’re constantly connected: The rise of the mobile communication especially smartphones actually means most people are constantly connected to the internet. People are no longer limited to desktop computers, we can get online at anytime we feel like which can be a good thing and also a bad thing. Being constantly connected can be a huge distraction in the lives of people but in others it can be a blessing.
